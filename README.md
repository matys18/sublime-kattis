# Sublime-Kattis

A Sublime Text 3 plugin for easily submitting problem solutions to [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com).

### Installation

The installation is performed in two steps:

1. Install the sublime Kattis package by ~~using Package Control~~ **coming soon**

2. Download a [configuration file](https://open.kattis.com/download/kattisrc), and place it under your home directory.

If for some reason you prefer to install this package without using Package Control, you can simply clone it under your ``Sublime Text/Packages`` directory (the exact path varies depending on what OS you're on).

### Usage

1. Name your submission file as the problem you are solving is named, and make sure you have the correct file extension for the programming language that you are using. For example, if I wanted to submit a solution to [hello](https://open.kattis.com/problems/hello) in ``Python``, my file would be named ``hello.py``. 

2. Once you're ready to submit, press ``Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`` to bring up the command panel, and type ``Kattis: Submit solution`` (you don't have to type all of it), click enter, confirm the details, and voila, you have submitted your solution to Kattis!
